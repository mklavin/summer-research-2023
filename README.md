# summer-research-2023
* photocatalyst_work contains work on structure-property relationship modeling of organic photocatalysts
* anil_acr stuff was used to generate smiles and fingerprints of anilines and acridiniums for a collaborator
* ligand_files was used to practice different ML applications using a dataset with known results from literature
